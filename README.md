# Civic-Issue-Reporting-System
Developed a prototype platform that empowers citizens to report local civic issues (like potholes, streetlight failures, waste management gaps) in real-time. The system aggregates, prioritizes, and routes issues to the concerned authorities, enabling faster resolutions and data-driven municipal decision-making.
